### What I learned

Due to the limitation of styles that can be applied to default radio input, I learned how to create keyboard accessible custom radio buttons.

### Useful resources

- [Custom radio button](https://www.a11ywithlindsey.com/blog/create-custom-keyboard-accessible-radio-buttons) - This is an amazing article on how to create keyboard accessible radio buttons. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
- [JS Mortgage Calculator formula](https://codepen.io/andarch/pen/qBxpeY) - This helped me implement the formula required for mortgage calculation.
